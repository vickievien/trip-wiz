## User Flow:

## Tech Stack:
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- REACT


## Approach:
Utilized a travel reviews model in which users are able to create, edit, and delete reviews of the trips they have been on.


## MVP:
- A working full-stack application, built by you, using Python, PostgreSQL and React.
- At least one model with full CRUD.
- At least three react components, defined in their own files, besides App.js.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public via Heroku
- Two git repositories not inside the class repo, one for your backend and one for your frontend.
- A README.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, unsolved problems, user stories, and notes to yourself so you can come back to your project later in the course and be able to pick up your train of thought, etc


## Stretch Goals:
- Mobile-First Approach
- Fully responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- React Router

## Future Add-Ons:
- Implementation of user login
- Third Party Travel API for additional trip recommendations
- Reversal of postings
